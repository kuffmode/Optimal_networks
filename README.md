For now, this is a rough implementation of the paper ["Navigable networks as Nash equilibria of navigation games"](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8651). I say rough because the paper has a lot more to offer and I only implemented the core algorithm for Eucledian space. This is my first OOP project so forgive me if the code is not very pythonic. BUT, at least **I think** it works as it should!
